    description__1: "This is a full stack MERN application I made and designed for my own small business. This project applied the depth of my knowledge in regards to MERN stacks, Redux, and SCSS. Before attempting to take on any paid clientele, I thought what better way to practice my MERN stack skills than by making a website for something that I am personally invested. The application also gave me a platform to make my company more legitimate, as well as giving my students and their parents a place to keep track of appointments. As this is essentially the culmination of my work so far(granted, not everything concept can be displayed), I worked hard to put forth a piece of work that is representative of my current level of understanding of programming.",
    description__2: "This project gave me what I needed most, which is experience. As someone who makes a living by teaching, I understand that to truly master a new skill, you have to practice organically producing the concept from your own mind. This really comes out when you practice. Besides practicing what I had already learned to look for areas of my understanding that needed attention, I used this application to practice implementing what I learned about Redux. Practicing it in my own application helped me understand how the store.js, reducers, and actions interact. Additionally, I made the project in a way so that I could practice the fundamentals of an eShop. This is mainly in regards to making payments by adding appointments to a “cart, ” and then eventually paying for them.",
    description__3: "The application is a MERN stack that uses SCSS as my CSS preprocessor and Redux to manage state. I had practiced Redux in other educational projects, but this was my first application where the creation of the Redux management system came organically. The HTML/ JSX and CSS / SCSS aspects of this project are pretty standard. The BEM naming convention is used as I find it a great asset to help manage and organize classes. The JSX combines necessary JavaScript methods to make code more concise. The Redux side of the application uses a standard file structure(store.js, reducers, actions, constants). The backend is make with Express.As with Redux, a standard file system is used(server.js, routes, controllers, middleware). MongoDB is set up also conventionally. Models and a config directory are used to organize the data flow. The React side is made with create-react-app. Standard naming conventions are also used. Users can sign make a profile, which they can use to schedule, view and pay for appointments. Additionally, users can leave review, and sent messages directly to my email. Admins can also be registered who can manage appointments and reviews by deleting, updating / verifying, and creating them.",

    skills: ["NodeJS", "React", "React-router", "CSS3"],
    description__1: "This application was initially designed to be used by a philanthropy in Davis whose work I really admire. In the end, I decided not to give my work to the group as they mistreated one of their founders, who is a dear friend of mine.",
    description__2: "Through the process of designing and creating this application, I was able to learn about and test my functional knowledge. As a teacher myself, I have learned to appreciate the art of fucking up. Once you accept that making mistakes is an essential part to learning, and that it is not something to be ashamed of, you will be able to master what concepts you desire. Inevitably, I did feel embarrassed quiet a bit at the mistakes I was making (mainly, using a .gitignore file correctly). To that extent, I learned a lot about git, specifically how to incorporate it into your app so that your code can be uploaded to github as a simple application or with submodules. After countless mistakes, I finally created my own notes on how exactly to accomplish this goal. Other small details include seeing what naming conventions I prefer (such as Pages vs Screens as directories) and designing an overall night time theme with a starry night animation background. This was the first time I created a full MERN stack on my own, and this project served as a fundamental part of my understanding of how data moves throughout the entire stack.",
    description__3: "The application is a MERN stack with SCSS as the chosen CSS preprocessor. The file structure used was getting organizationally to where I am at today, but it admittedly is not ideal. The frontend directory is labeled as NM2 simply due to problems uploading my code to git; it was initially a submodule that I couldn’t quiet incorporate into my main repository. The backend of the application is in the root, which despite finding this as a common practice amongst some professionals, I find taxing to navigate. The standard BEM naming convention was used and practiced to further experiment with functional names.  Express was used as my chosen framework to write my Node.js backend. Visitors to the site can sign up for a newsletter (Mailchimp) and send messages to my email (Nodemailer). The frontend was built using create-react-app. The file structure is pretty standard, but follows a slightly less refined naming convention than what I currently use. Nonetheless, I want to keep it this way for my own reference and future considerations about the matter. Mapbox was used to set a map, which I proudly figured out that I can use with the full width of the UI while still getting the application to scroll if on the map in mobile. To accomplish this, I used a simple overlay with a greater z-index. Of course, this is relatively basic, but getting myself to design concepts independently is nonetheless exciting and necessary to become a professional software engineer.",

    skills: ["HTML5", "SCSS"],
    description__1: "This project was made to practice CSS. This not only includes fundamentals, such as Flexbox, CSS Grid, and the many CSS properties, but also a few more advanced tools. These include SCSS and general UX design incorporation.",
    description__2: "As CSS and SCSS were not much more than concepts to me at this point, practicing actually using implementing what I learned proved to give me the most knowledge. I also was able to practice using NPM to install dependencies and run/design scripts. As with CSS, the application of what I had taught myself in these areas proved valuable, as I now feel confident in both areas.",
    description__3: "The code is nothing more than a HTML and CSS; no boiler plate or framework was used. However, a professional file structure was used, including directories for abstracts, base, components, layout, pages, themes and vendors. Although I have not found a better file system, this was a necessary step to testing out what I most rational. As this project was intended to focus on CSS, all animations were designed using cascading style sheets. These include aesthetically pleasing button and card animations, as well as the use of the cubic-bezier property on the navigation links. Additionally, the search bar responds to user actions. SVG icons were used with colors corresponding to their individual organization.",

    description__1: "This was the first completely independent project that I made. It was intended to gain experience applying what I had taught myself about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. To increase my interest in the project, I decided to make it about one of my favorite activities in life: traveling. The project displays highlights from my fourth trip to Indonesia.",
    description__2: "As this was my first true solo programming endeavor, I was able to learn a lot about HTML, CSS and JavaScript simply through application. In regards to HTML, I learned how the standard markup language is organized between a head and a body, and the relevant code per each. I also got to learn the nuances between similar HTML tags, such as divs, sections, spans and ps, and classes and IDs. Furthermore, I was introduced to HTML entities to display special characters (such as &mdash; for a longer, more visually pleasing dash). This application also helped further my understanding of using jQuery and JavaScript to create simple animations to aid with UX. When I eventually decided to push my code up to github, I learned how to run a static webpage on Heroku through scripts in the applications package.json file.",
    description__3: "The code, as stated before, was relatively simple. Beyond a standard file system for HTML and CSS, I also wrote a directory for JavaScript. The relevant code is used for animating sections. Mapbox was used for the first time. Although I hadn’t quite leaned the in’s and out’s, trying it out was a big first step. The CSS side of things use SVGs, which I found to be an improvement for ion icons for reasons that I would later truly understand (SVG animations). In addition, simple hover animations were implemented.",

    name: "Hackernews Clone",
    skills: ["React", "React-router", "CSS3"],
    description__1: "This project was part of a React course by Tyler McGinnis. It was designed to teach how to use React with functional components, React Router, JSX, and interacting with an API from the client side.",
    description__2: "By going through the process of making this application, I was able to get a very good understanding of React, so that I felt confident to work with the framework upon its completion. The hands-on experience of creating this taught me a lot about React Hooks, such as the fundamental built in hooks (useReducer, useState, useEffect, useContext, etc.) as well as React Router, and JSX syntax. The React Router part of the application was simple, yet it helped me understand how to use its own built in functionality, such as Links and Routes and getting data from a url using useParams. The application also helped me understand how to apply the DRY principle to programming, as well as slimming down components by moving logic/functions to separate documents. Finally, I was able to practice working with a real API. As basic as that sounds, it was undoubtedly crucial towards my development as a programmer. I found it especially intriguing and useful to my overall understanding as it was all done on the front end, something that I appreciate knowing now that I do it mainly via Express.",
    description__3: "The application does have a back end directory, but this was used solely to run it on Heroku. The frontend is made with create-react-app. The file structure follows a fairly standard convention, as there are directories for components, contexts, css, and utils. The built in hooks of React are seen throughout used properly. One example of this is useReducer, which is used to send requests and handle responses from the Hacker News API. Once responses from the API were received, data was then shown on the client side. The logic within functional components has been moved out to separate components to improve readability and understanding of the components themselves. JSX is used properly, with fundamental application of ternary operators and the double ampersand as an alternative, when necessary. useContext was used to share a theme throughout the application. This variability in theme was being able to elect to use a dark mode interface.",
