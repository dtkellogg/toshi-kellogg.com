            My expertise is building web applications using a MERN stack.
            I have extensive knowledge and experience in HTML, CSS 
            (<span className="skills__blue-text">SASS</span>), JavaScript 
            (<span className="skills__blue-text">React</span> and <span className="skills__blue-text">Node</span>), and Redux.

            I am also able to solve algorithm problems using all of the standard strategies. 
            These include recursion, DFS, BFS, DP, binary search, hash tables, arrays, and string manipulation.

            I enjoy writing code cleanly, and through my ability to patiently observe and learn from other programmersâ€™ 
            work, I am able to write code following a uniform pattern, which is both necessary and highly effective for 
            large-scale stacks.
